## 🔐 Authentication (JWT & OAuth2)

**Feature:**
Secure user authentication using JWT for stateless sessions and OAuth2 for third-party login integration.

**Details:**

### **JWT Authentication**
- **User Registration:** New users can create an account by providing necessary information such as email, username, and password.
- **Login:** Existing users can log in using their username/email and password. Upon successful login, a **JWT token** is generated and sent back to the user.
  - The JWT token contains:
    - User information (e.g., user ID)
    - Expiration time
    - A secret key to verify the authenticity of the token.
- **Token Storage:** The token is stored in local storage or an HTTP-only cookie, depending on security requirements.
- **Token Validation:** For each subsequent request, the user sends the token in the HTTP Authorization header as `Bearer <token>`. The backend validates the token, ensuring it's not expired or tampered with.
- **Secure Routes:** Routes requiring authentication (such as placing an order or viewing order history) check if the request includes a valid JWT token.

### **OAuth2 Authentication**
- **Third-Party Login Integration:** Users can log in using their **Google**, **Facebook**, or other OAuth2-supported platforms.
- **OAuth2 Flow:** The application follows the standard OAuth2 authorization flow:
  1. **Authorization Request:** The user is redirected to the third-party platform’s login page.
  2. **Access Token Retrieval:** After the user logs in, the third-party platform redirects back to the application with an authorization code, which is exchanged for an access token.
  3. **User Information:** The access token is used to request user information from the third-party platform’s API (such as name, email, etc.).
- **Token Handling:** The application stores the OAuth2 access token, either in local storage or session storage, to manage the user session.
- **Account Linking:** If the user already has an account, they can link their third-party OAuth2 login to their existing account for future logins.

### **Secure Routes and Role-Based Access**
- **JWT Middleware:** The backend checks for a valid JWT token for any protected routes. If the token is invalid or expired, the user is denied access and asked to log in again.
- **Role-Based Access:** Users with different roles (e.g., admin, regular user) have access to different routes:
  - Admins can view and manage all orders and users.
  - Regular users can only view and manage their own orders.

### **Logout:**
- **JWT Logout:** When the user logs out, the token is deleted from the local storage or invalidated by the backend if using a token blacklist.
- **OAuth2 Logout:** The user is logged out from the OAuth2 provider (e.g., Google) and their session is ended in the application.

### **Token Expiry & Refresh Tokens**
- **Access Token Expiry:** JWT tokens typically have a short lifespan (e.g., 15 minutes). After expiration, the user must either log in again or use a **refresh token**.
- **Refresh Tokens:** A refresh token is issued alongside the access token and is used to obtain a new access token when the original expires.
  - Refresh tokens are stored securely and can be exchanged for a new access token by sending the refresh token to a secure endpoint.
